Real-time 3D fractal explorer in a custom-built engine. The custom-built engine is developed from the Light Weight Java Game Library (LWJGL) for the Open Graphics Library (OpenGL). The depth of computed fractals is restricted by data-type precision. In order to achieve true deep zoom functionality, arbitrary precision arithmetics is required. This project aims to explore arbitrary precision arithmetics on the Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
